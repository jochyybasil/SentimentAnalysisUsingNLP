on the tv i be flick through my tv guide and happen to see this film it didnt much detail except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have oken up jared harris star id never hear of him he play john or aiden quinn who play paul however they be certainly underestimated actor the film have a slow start but a it develop i could see how well quinn but especially harris play their character a a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney be like the script be illiant and harris get lennon accent personality and mannerism spot on quinn play mccartney quite well but sometimes go into his irish accent the makeup artist make them look excellent.this paragraph may be count a a spoiler a i mention before it get off to a slow start but soon develop and become quite an emotional film i find the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musician a for lennon rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the end be very poignant and ings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it.it be quite different from the other biographical film ive see where it about how the beatles get together and become famous and those never really do the character that well e.g backbeat.in conclusion i would say if youre a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about minute long it worth wait for the film to develop.if anyone do know whether the meeting of really do happen please send it to the comment page for this film id be very interested\n","neg: 0.029,

after the first ten minute or so the directing degenerate quickly it a if the movie be so long that the director realize that there wasnt enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what result be some mediocre vampire scene and plenty of cheesy special effect unfortunately queen of the damn fails to do the genre justice just a it john carpenter counterpart fail to impress where

that save this movie from be garbage prop to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become a renowned actress have her life not be take from u so prematurely for she do give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dance do i mention that the soundtrack be good let see what else can i say it wasnt too long the anne rice novel could have easily be a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola get his hand on it there be a few twist and turn here and there in the plot but all in all it be a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of secondrate vampire movie out there the director of this movie go on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tell you anything.jyjimboduckdotcom\n","neg: 0.093, neu: 0.725,

reality of what the new world require be disparage and rude salvatore doesnt change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually be

romance and one of the premiere cast matchup of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead role a evident on this board the picture doesnt pas muster with purist who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story tell to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story a if it be a work of fiction i know i know thats hard to do when you consider custer last stand at the little big horn and it prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it.theres a lot to take in here though for the picture two hour plus run time custer arrival at west point be probably the first head scratcher rid up a he do in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy put him up in the major headquarters probably should have get them both in trouble.ironically a lot of scene in this military film play for comedy a in custer first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounter that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadnt notice it before in other film but mcdaniel remind me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forty mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it look like it might have be moreland ham it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene be a hoot too.as for flynn it interesting to note that a year earlier he portray j.e.b stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vie for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynns portrayal here it more than evident but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligan take on the military hero in s little big man let just say that one be a bit over the top.the good take away the picture have for me be the manner in which custer persevere to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he lead in battle along with the discipline he develop over the course of the story most poignant be that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before rid into the little big horn in which he declare that hell or glory be entirely dependent on one point of view earlier a similar

in the butterfly effect im still not completely sell on him something about the guy just annoys me probably have to do with his simian features.it take approximately two minute for my fear to subside and for my hesitancy to slip away the movie immediately throw u into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i be grip tight than kenny rogers orange face lift my concern iefly istled at kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort be make to paint him a ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglass a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk thatd make george clooney proud yeah we get it i be totally ready to hate him.but then he have to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jab darn you ape man efficiently mix tense excite rescue scene drama humor and solid act the guardian be easily a film that i dare say the majority of audience will enjoy you can quibble about it clichã©s predictability and rare moment of overcooked sappiness but none of that take away from the entertainment value.i have a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner start train the young guy but on the contrary the training session just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmer be hero whose story have never really be portray on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it be to make it be very informative and a great way to introduce audience to this underappreciated group.do you have what it take to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous mission in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while try to help strand panicked people who be depend on you for their survival and if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who life and who dies.man who want all that responsibility not me i have no idea what it be really like for these guy and who would have think id have an ashton kutcher/kevin costner movie to thank for the education not only do the guardian do a great job of pay tribute to this rare eed of hero but lucky for u it also do a good job of entertain it pay customers.the gist moviegoer want an inside look at what it like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but have i pay i wouldve felt i have get my money worth\n","neg: 0.105, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.209, compound: 0.9978, \n","go into see

ridiculous i always leave my disbelief strictly suspend above the door of the screen before enter and collect it on the way out i couldnt here.a father and son be hunt in the wood the damage ship crash land to from the view give i would calculate at the very least odd mile away through thick woodland the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hug even at this point you

what a scare some shock to titillate the perverse what if you really want to shock titillate and scare people who be not pregnant or expect father or who have no soul why not just have the alien/predator shag the saucy woman and teenage girl rather than kill them the character have no depth and neither do the plot it film and pace badly it act by disinterested people not that i can

yet meet but the film begin loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodel while ski it be do so unsubtly and make my teeth grind but i stick it outespecially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stop the yodeling in hindsight perhaps i should have just turn it off then fonda be knock out in the fall and barbara go for help back at the ski lodge he seem okay but fortunately she be also a doctor and have him xrayed and nurse him back to health he in turn becomes infatuate with her and propose to her despite hardly know each other they marry and so far the film seem like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.once home however all isnt rosy a she jump right back into her job a a family doctor and he begin exhibit sign that he be a control and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film play it all for laugh but frankly fondas behavior be really creepyspying on her and her male patient attack or threaten any man she treat trip a patient who already have a back injury and stomp into a surprise party and insist that everyone there men and woman be out to steal away his wife he come off a a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it all suppose to be for laughs consider that he seem like a dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restrain order but oddly she get mad but just cant stay mad at fonda because he so ........ i cant think of the right wordcreepy be all that come to mind later out of the blue multimillionaire fonda get a job work the counter at a department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy be all a thing of the pastso a job apparently cure anger and suspicion when this job fall through the film end with fonda buy his own hospital give barbara a job there and they live happily ever after they dont go any far with the story but i assume base on fonda character that he then spend most of his time a hospital administrator beat up all the male patients.the first portion at the ski lodge and the next do not fit well together nor do the final horatio alger inspire section where the rich boy make good in the business world they be like three separate plot but despite this the most serious problem with the film be it seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what a creepy little film

look at it now it obvious to any fan of movie that blake edward create this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director have strike gold with andrew in musical mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrew be snub from star in project make famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood think she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake create this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical darling lili suffers from multiple personality never know who or what it be some specific scene be good or effective but a a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it be very embarrassing.mind you the version on the dvd be the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in release the dvd edward cut scene from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it be we be minute into it and we still dont know whats go on or why be watch whats go what kind of spy be lili how powerful be she be she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch a thoroughly bore look rock hudson try to woo a thoroughly bore look julie andrew thing arent help much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why do julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she get involve with there should have be one of her ex hang around try to win her back or try to decipher her secret this would have give u some much need contrast to the muddle action it would also have give u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding theres no catalyst in this story.one only have to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just come up with idea inspire by andrew and edward previous successes the best or bad example be the scene when andrew and hudson follow a group of child who sing in the middle of a forest edward channel sound of music it no wonder he remove it from the dvd back in that scene might have work on a certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there be other plot element directly inspire by andrews/edwards other film the endless scene of dogfight be inspire by the much good modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guess be create just to make fun of july mary poppins persona which be turn raunchy with julie do a striptease in the act the end bird eye view of julie run towards hudson plane be another wink at sound of music.the whole thing be confuse julie play a singer bear from a german father and british mother who live in england but sing her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment be just badly edit like when julie and her uncle be on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in midsentence im like what happen here the comedy bit be unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police be pathetic wheres peter seller when you really need him the action be stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle be on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoots round of bullet at the train almost kill lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene be the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow move train there the musical moment the beginning be the best part of the entire film and the reason i give this film star but it effect be diminish considerably because it repeat at the end speaking of redundant do we really need to see a cancan dance crepe suzette strip scene and julie strip too the girl in no man land be ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldier at a french hospital make me wonder how many soldier there be injure indirectly by the result of her spy the whole project be listless and without energy the romance be unbelievable rock hudson be way too old and tire look check out the museum scene julie look daze like shes on valium but what really kill this illconceived project be julie play a german spy edward desperately want to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflict his wife and believe that play a traitor be a good career decision as much a i like julie shes no greta garbo who pull it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play a german spy

opinion the main problem i have with the ceremony be the format with the minor oscar hand out to the winner who be sit in their seat theres no such thing a a minor oscar and just because the award be for best animate short or best costume design theyre a well deserve a best picture or best director all the winner should be allow to march up to the podium what a bunch of arrogant snob the academy

would split the award for best director and best picture while i think the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have make it a dead cert for best picture while mdbs controversial subject

where iwerks continue develop his style and technique and where he create the character of flip the frog while his work keep the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by the studio be close later that year iwerks be hire by columbia picture and iwerks decide to return to his old skeleton for another dance this time in color.s skeleton frolic be essentially a remake of the classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it be set on an abandon graveyard where at midnight the creature of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffin ready for the show thats about to begin a a group of skeleton have form an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it not easy to be a musician made of just bone a some of the orchestra member have problem with their body part however the band manage to put a good show and another group of skeleton begin to dance a lovely couple of them face the same problem that trouble the orchestra it hard to dance with loose body part everything end at dawn and just when the sun be about to rise again the skeleton run towards their graves.directed and animate by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolic follow faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance year before although with a crucial difference iwerks do the whole film in technicolor the ight tonality allow iwerks to create a more visually appeal film and also to use the many new technique he have be practice since leave disney create even well effect of depth and dynamism than those he conceive before it be certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesnt mean it necessarily a good film for starter the film be practically identical to the one he do with disney with the only difference be the music more on that later and the color effect it look beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feel kind of unoriginal after all.however it be not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurt the film after all iwerks execute it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody create by joe denat for the film be pretty uninteresting and lack the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one do by carl w. stall for the skeleton dance in other word while denats tune be effective and appropriate for the theme it easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling song have a unique personality that make it unforgettable be a musical film this be of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music ings down iwerks flawless work of animation personally i think that with a good musical accompaniment skeleton frolic would be remember as fondly a the skeleton dance despite not be as groundeaking a it still a fun film to watch.its kind of sad that most of the work iwerks do after leave disney be now forget due to his poor success however it must be say that if iwerks lack the popularity of disney or fleischer disney main rival he do not

and the plot seem like it be the result of merge several disparate script a a result it often make absolutely no sense at all and certainly be not a film miss dunne or mr. huston should have be proud of make however the film be worth watch if you be a fan of precode film because it feature an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly say that nice girl do put outeven if they arent marry and even if their partner be the film begin with miss dunne a a social worker assist troop head to europe for wwi in the process she meet a scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convince her to sleep with him she become pregnant and he then go on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne do not want him back a she realize he not worth it but later her baby die at child birth while all these very controversial plot element be use they be always allude toalmost like they want the adult in the audience to know but hop that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kid in the audience will be clueless after all film be not rat and kid might attend any film at this time .surprisingly this entire plot involve a stillborn baby and cabot end about of the way through the film and be never mention again or allude to it be a if they film part of a movie and abandon ittacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begin work at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her do anything there what we do see be countless horrible scene of severe abuse and torture that be probably design to titillate and a a result of all this violence miss dunne go on a crusade to clean up the prison and become a reformer and famous writer.but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the woman prison reform business go by the wayside dunne meet a judge walter huston who be married but he desperately want her now throughout the film dunne be portray a a very good girleven though she do have unmarried sex with cabot she be more or less trick into it but now single irene who be a tireless reformer and good lady begin sleep with a married man he tell her that he and his wife be estrange and be marry in name only but she never think to investigate if this be true and with his assurance off fly her clothes and they be in the baby making business but while shes pregnant with his love child he indict for be a crooked judge he assure her hes innocent but he convict and it sure sound like he a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune then in the final moment of the film miss dunne try in vain to get him free and vow to wait with the child until huston be release the film then ends.so we basically have three separate film and a bizarre early s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gather that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly become an idiot in her personal relationship this really undo all the positive about dunnes character and it really hard to imagine anyone like the film a strong woman right advocate might easily be offend at how weakminded and needy she be and religious people might see her a totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent rewrite this could have be a good film or at least interesting a a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up it mind what it want to be

game to convey story plot element and it do so very subtly do your homework before watch this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise itll be that much better.with that in mind this film have some of the most spectacular cg sequence i have ever witness the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroid yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action orient one be so impeccable it leave me with a sense of awe.i believe the soundtrack be simplify so a to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who be familiar with the ff story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhance the animation .once again i myself have only play through ff once thoroughly enjoy this piece of art from square enix and that be the feel in most scene choreograph and organize like a dance.in short if you enjoy the music or the game final fantasy this film will blow you out of the water if youre in the unfortunate majority who have not experience

character move with fluidity each scene background come to life and tell it own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reaction subtle clue that ing about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.square enix and the great tetsuya nomura have set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent child have usher in a new era for cg animation allow the subtlety that lie in each character to speak volume in and of themselves.thanks square enix the wait be well

be document through the world of animation for those who have forget what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer â– when it in the right hand that be â– a bugs life be a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalie film productions.it be only pixars second animate feature the subgroup of disney make their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in with their landmark movie toy story it be a movie which defy convention reinvent and eathed new life into animation and define a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draw a creep sense of cynicism in u all prior to see the film.after all it a film about ant well all walk of the insect and bug world be cover in a bugs life but it be the ant which be the focal point in this film a human be the focal point in drama romance and so on how can such an insignificant specie of animal such a an ant act a the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox item be able to become the grand most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated hero and villain ever concoct the guy at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter.not only be they all entirely amiable and likable â– there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villain be rivet character â– but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of character be also gargantuan for lack of a good term only add the rich layer of distinctiveness already plaster onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name be flik david foley and his character be rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant reside on the lush beautiful ant island he be the one consider the black sheep of the clan a see in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroy the season harvest with his antics.the problem arise in the fact that the ant harvest be for a bunch of greedy grasshopper lead by hopper kevin spacey who be eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering be go they go insane for lack of a good term hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack hand however it a negotiation which be simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers.if you think about it a bugs life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk be threaten by malevolent and wicked enemy â– one lone villagedweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help come in the form of a downandout circus troupe who be mistakenly perceive by flik a warrior in a barroom awl.much amusement come out of these scene and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug among them be an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug who in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it exceedingly enjoyable watch these bug onscreen a it be watch the bug and the insect interact onscreen a be the entire movie collectively.as ive say much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious line wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall a dazzling movie what make a bugs life even well be that the film isnt restrict simply to child a many may perceive it to be although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film â– the clichã©d kidfriendly situation be a bit more abundant than wed like however it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this film.although a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by it predecessor this be still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have prove that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artist in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manage to top their standard it only always by themselves what more be there to say about a bug life other than see it it not quite the best which weve see from the folk at emeryville california but this beat out the lot of it year â– and ill be damn if this isnt the best animated feature of ..\n","neg: 0.091, neu: 0.738, pos: 0.171, compound: 0.9986,

me just comment on what i like about the movie the special effect be fantastic and very rarely do i feel like i be watch a video game there that be the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone read this to take note that i cant even put into word how hard it be for me to write this review without swear i have innumerable complaint about the film but four major complaint jump to mind my first major complaint have to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it come a mile away where loiss yearold son turn out to be the superpowered child of superman when the cry superchild throw a piano at lexs henchman to save his mother i almost get up and leave the theater singer could have make a much good superman movie without resort to cheap gimmick like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child it be day since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit my next major complaint have to do with the fact that superman lift a continent make out of kryptonite up into out space it doesnt take comic book guy from the simpson to point out whats wrong with that i dont know how many comic book brian singer have read but when superman be expose to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely have the strength to stay on his foot whoever have the idea to have him fly a large island make out of his great weakness into space have no business be associate with any supermanrelated project ever again the concept be as ridiculous a make a dracula movie where the title character have a stake through his heart and still manage to fly a spaceship make out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then ush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajama thats not any more absurd then have him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burn up in reentry or splatter all over central park when he hit the ground my third major complaint have to do with the fact that singer slap moviegoer across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman a the only son of a godlike jorel send to earth to be a savior jorel wasnt allwise he be just a scientist and he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he throw him in a rocket and hurriedly fire it into space because his planet be about to explode ill buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god send christ to earth because heaven be about to explode and then radioactive piece of heaven become christ primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stab superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just make me want to slam my face into a ick until im too aindead to notice the azenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be taint the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman return the passion of the christ.and speaking of luthor my last major complaint have to do with singer depiction of lex luthor lex luthor be a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who be more apt to run for president which he do in the comic than try to destroy the world the man want money and power he want to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman return as well a all the previous superman movie be a wacky theatrical dunce who come up with zany scheme to destroy the world if singer have the slight loyalty to the character instead of the quite awful previous superman movie this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singer next project can be a batman movie where he focus on the interpretation of batman from s tv show zam whap pow to summarize i dont know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be give it good review everyone be entitle to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion be wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who read this not to see this movie if you havent already dont see it dont buy it when it come out on dvd dont rent it ... basically dont contribute any money towards it in any way this movie do not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that see this movie bryan singer should be fin billion

from and the creation of caprica have just enough advanced and contemporary technology throw in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to u a viewers.the only real weak point i notice be the relationship between the greystone parent and the actress who play lacy rand while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually together their scene seem to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to develop their character but this be something i think needs work i also find magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and

why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of u want to get into debt by own a set of wheel which come with tax when they reach our shore and the myriad of tax and bill to pay when operate one not only that the high end sport car be once quip by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear l they reach the sea.and these movie be relatively easy to make hot wheel and hot chick always go down well together in target the required demographic for once those plunge neckline expose uncanny buxom and short skirt accentuate legs two meter long cant compete with the attention give to those beautiful curve that exotic car posse in movie such a these of course there be amongst u ahem those that go for the sexist portrayal of woman a mere sexual object otherwise explain why motor show come with truckloads of model and movie such a these can not do without a leggy model in a frame however they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sigh whenever the four wheeler come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gear into park the guy sit beside me i swear he wet his pant every time his dream car s appear and cream his pant even more when he hear those growl engine moans.so there we have it the fan boy who turn up in drove just to watch which of the late cool car get feature in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese model like the evos and the skyline take centerstage as do the gt here the ford gt take on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification that even im impressed alongside the late model like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that have wing for door but seriously my heart go out to the car each time theyre mercilessly wreck just for entertainment i mean this be perfectly fine high performance model that be at the apex of motor but yet because whoever finance the movie have million to blow they do so because they cantheres no story in redline just excuse to put together a movie full of beauty the car that be that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shot of pedal always the accelerator mind you tap the ake pedal be tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steer wheel gear shift always shift up and not down all these while have the actor make pretend that theyre the baddest ass with an engine snarling and give each other dirty look not a very tall order for an actor and thats why we get the most woeful performance ever with line that seem to be write by elementary schoolkids.the heroine yes it make a statement that girl can drive natasha a very plasticky look nadia bjorlin be one of those million dollar find a girl with model look who dont mind get down on four and immerse in oil who have race pedigree within her and performs with a rock band sing song with lyric that be just plain laughable every line have to do with car and when sing about love just have to string those innuendo like shift gear shafts luicants and go for ride introduce against her wish to illegal racing by a gangsta call infamous eddie griffin she get draw into family squabble involve a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous look rich uncle everything else well like i say just serve a an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.and it almost always the same a there very limit to what you can do to heighten tension between race car especially when you know the race be rig for narrative reason and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious have quite charismatic actor and i will put my head on the chop block by name paul walker sun kang and of course the star it create vin

war movie i find it surprising that rotj be consider the weak installment in the trilogy by many who have vote to me it seem like rotj be the best because it have the most profound plot the most suspense surprise most emotional especially the end and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strike back a lot also but i think it be slightly less good than than rotj since it be slowermoving be not a episodic and i just do not feel as much suspense or emotion a i do with the third movie.it also seem like to me that after read these surprising review that the reason people cite for rotj be an inferior film to the other two be just plain ludicrous and be insignificant reason compare to the sheer excellence of the film a a whole i have hear many strange reason such a a because yoda die b because bobba fett die c because small ewoks defeat a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader be revealedi would like to debunk each of these reason because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who care if bobba fett die if george lucas want him to die then he want him to die dont get me wrong i be fan of bobba fett but he make a few cameo appearance and it be not lucas intention to make him a central character in the film that star war fan make him out to be his name be not even mention anywhere in the movie ... you have to go to the credit to find out bobba fetts name judge rotj because a minor character die be a bit much i think ... secondly many fan do not like yoda die sure it be a momentous period in the movie i be not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic all the good guy cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guy live and all the bad guy die this movie would have be tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not like yodas death .. well nobody complain when darth vader strike down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why be obi wan death okay but yodas not ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm .... another reason i just can not believe be even state be because people find cute ewoks overpower stormtroopers to be impossible that be utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks be in their native planet endor so they be cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the ewoks use in defeat the stormtroopers be through excellent use of their home field advantage since you live in the forest all your life i hope you would have learn to use it to your advantage they have swing vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroopers be highly disadvantage because they be outnumber and not aware of the advantage of the forest the only thing they have be their blaster to add it be not like the ewoks be battle the stormtroopers themselves they be heavily assist by the band of rebel in that conquest i think that if the stormtroopers be to have defeat a combination of the star war heros the band of rebel as well a the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have be a great upset lastly if this scene be still unbelievable to you .. how about in empire strike back or in a new hope where there be several scene of a group consist of just han solo chewbacca and the princess be shoot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster miss while the hero be in full view and not only that the hero of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blaster the trooper must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strike back the battle of endor be much more believable since you have two army pit each other not hero against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our hero be escape landos base or when our hero be rescue princess leia and be shoot at somehow they miss a han solo and luke be try to exit the death star.the last reason that i care to discuss others be just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here be that people do not like darth vader be reveal well in many way that be a major part of the plot in the movie luke be try to find whether or not darth vader be his father annakin skywalker it would have be disappoint if the movie have end without luke get to see his father face because it make it complete by annakins revelation it symbolize the transition darth vader underwent from be possess by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he be annakin skywalker by remove the helmet the point be that annakin die convert to the light side again and that be what the meaning of the helmet removal scene be about in fact thats be what i would have do in that scene too if i be luke father ... isnt that what you would have do if you want to see your son with your own eye before you die and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people be that the sequel must be bad even if it be well that precede movie be another reason that rotj do not get a many accolade a it deserve i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be good or bad that the original .. but i can not know for sure .. let see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into think that a clearly superior film be not as good a it really was.i be not sure who criticize these movie but i have ask many college student and adult about which be their favorite star war movie and they all tell me except for one person that say that a new hope be their favorite that it be rotj i believe that the result on these poll be appal and quite misleading.bottom line the return of the jedi be the best of the trilogy this movie be the only one of the three that keep me rivet all throughout it minute there be not a moment of boredom because each scene be either suspenseful excite surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj be good than the one in the empire strike back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fan start look for nitpicky insignificant detail or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such a this movie stink because luke be not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffer unfortunately\n","neg: 0.151,

like a loaded gun across when the dead body be actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the ief featurette on the warner dvd doesnt mention that novelist richard brook disown the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an antisemitic one but it interesting to note that while the victim be kill primarily because he be jewish there little doubt in sam levenes performance that the

other side for a change this movie concentrate on a group of german soldier who after fight in the north africa campaign be send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloody battle of ww ii be be fought.its interest to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the german simply a the villain in this movie those villain be give an humane face and voice and it sort of make you realize that the only true enemy in war be war itself and not necessarily those who youre fight against at first it kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german be the evil villain but of course you get accustom to it quickly and you soon adapt the german a the main character of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them.the way this story be tell isnt however the best it hard to keep track of the story at time a it jump from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isnt always logic in it storytelling and feature a bit too many sequence that remain too vague it also be most of the time pretty hard to keep the character apart and see who be who it doesnt always make this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there be plenty enough sequence and moment present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movie be always good than european movies.the production value be high and feature some good look set and location though the movie wasnt even shoot in russia itself it help to create a good war time situation atmosphere.the character be mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic but i dont know for some reason formulaic character always work out fine in war movie and strenghtens the drama and realism it also help that theyre be play by well cast actor all of the actor arent the best known actor around thomas kretschmann be also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and give it character an unique face and personality.all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely

ecologically theme and have an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that be animate could thoroughly enjoy if give the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movie children.that say i be at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else be you go to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthral a year old my niece amber love it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus a year old my nephew aaron who review be of course it be good everything miyazakisan do be good a year old animation fan ought to tear by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother character and im bet the old chara too and love the cuteness of the child characters.and that be what i respect most about miyazakisan he seem to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface ponyo could be see a a simple story about a little fishgirl who get a taste of the human world and want to join it and the friend she make there a little boy name soske somewhat like the little mermaid but there be an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki populate his film with intensely strong female character ponyos mother soskes mother the old lady in a nursing home be all genuine character with mind of their own and extremely strong willed.but the girl who take the cake be ponyo herself once she decide that she like the human world she simply use her own will to achieve her dream her father be try to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young ponyo know what she want and become human out of simply her own determination once human she team up with her friend soske whom she love very much although maybe not as much a ham soske be ask to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decide she have to help the people at the rest home where she work during a typhoon that have be inadvertently cause by ponyo on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes he relate to the jonas others can we just get past that please give perhaps the best performance in the film a young soske which be good since he have the most line his character be also strong will but also very respectful and friendly characteristic youre not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific.in the end ponyos father fujimoto must cope with his daughter decision and his estranges wifes wish to allow her to be human he hop that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuse to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki have for some reason receive some criticism for this it be honestly what make his movie magical and yet relatable no one in real life be completely a bad person all human be various shade of gray and that be exactly what miyazaki do with his character and then theres the animation itself in a time when cgi would certainly have help with the copious amount of effect shot in this film especially the water miyazaki have choose to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation be color by digital mean but every film in this be handdrawn and i for one be extremely grateful for that the character animation be extremely fluid and there even appear to be some lipsync go on quite unusual for an anime film the background seem to be render with colored pencil and have an effect all it own on the audience this be what animation use to look like and what it should look like in the end i find ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not

the movie isnt any good actually it bloody awful but i didnt expect anything else when i buy it it a low budget horror movie with a chupacaa monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actor and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie be really baaaaaaad.this movie have some of the bad act i have ever see the actor try to hard and t it get completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it so stupid it almost look like a freakin parody it like they shoot each scene only one single time and be happy about it the bad of them all be the blond girl which be suppose to play a bimbo shes the bad of them all i have never see an actor as bad a her

will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely fill with diamond at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the oppose team likeness secretely fill with the payment for the diamond to varify that they be there the winning team would then receive a dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who have be hot on their heel for some time now would never suspect them because they be just kid however this seem to be redundant because on their travel the kid do not have to go through any security check and be never even question about the

song get lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grow old and learn about life it become clear that that song be a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience know the color of the chipettes panty this be especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes be be chase by the arabian prince men when eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this do nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seem to mind that there be foot tall chipmunk walk around and speak in incredibly highpitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the chipmunk and get home the direction of janice karman perfect this movie a she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr. know the character good

documentary that will examine a theme totally but when i read the review already write on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes dont know what to criticize therefore to be clear ill divide this film into two major part that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his director career and latter one about visconti the director the aristocratic background all the hobby the wealth that young luchino experience and enjoy be clearly present his effort in horse racing be mention as well a his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parent divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino be ought up a a real count of milano in rich galore with nanny cook with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his father splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villa prove that there be also an emphasis on visconti crucial visit in paris in the s where he meet eminent people leave winger who later have impact on his style and message in art that clearly explain the idea of a communist with the aristocratic up a contrast at first sight however the part about his director career which start with ossessione during wwii and end with innocente just before the director death in be poorly execute his movie be not discuss well why because there be very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remember the work on la terra trema and that be all right there be also some interview with franco rosi but later such movie like il gattopardo la caduta dei rei la morte a venezia or ludwig be mostly discuss by helmut berger although i like the actor in the role of ludwig i do not like the interview of his moreover some thought he reveals be not accurate to entail in such a documentary ... there be no mention of significant work of visconti like conversation piece there be no interview with eminent cast burt lancaster a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be make there be one footage interview with maria calla that appear to be interesting but that be only a short bit franco zeffirelli though i appreciate him a a director make fun of it all rather than say something really precious for instance he mention the event how visconti separate from him after year of service therefore i say simplify and unsatisfactory what i find a strong point here be footage interview with visconti himself a a result we may get his own opinion about his work for instance i very much appreciate the word he say about death regard it a a normal chapter of life and as natural a birth itself he also discuss his health problem after the stroke while film ludwig.i believe it be well to see luchino visconti by carlo lizzani than this doc although it be short and

welldeveloped in contrast to the many snippet from those who feel that the drug that happen to currently be illegal be a scourge for which the only imaginable solution be incarceration of even those who be guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.although this program a a whole leave the viewer with the impression that the drug war be largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserve some praise almost nothing in this documentary address the very real problem that total war against those who merely possess illegal drug obviously cause and contributes tovery real problem that most drug warrior themselves would tell you if ask they think the drug war be design to solve for example while many minute be spend on the surge in violence associate with the rise popularity of crack cocaine in the s at no point do this program even hint that the very law design to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug seller to enforce their contract and business arrangement in court of law force them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of see the law a an important cause of the violence the drug themselves seem to take the unt of the blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensue and the subsequent reversal of prohibition be totally ignore by this program.this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotype of drug user and it be these that be the primary force in drive the very expensive and very problematic drug war the possibility of incorporate drug other than alcohol into a happy and successful life be not really touch on use of any drug in excess be probably go to cause personal problem but not all user do their drug in excess just like not all alcohol user be alcoholics.if you want a point of view from someone who believe that adult have a moral right not to be incarcerate and have their life ruin by the criminal justice system just for use drug that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reason rather than reason base on sound social policy and legitimate science have decide to totally prohibit whose user it have decide to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it none of that be in here.on the other hand this be hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda it be mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drug in th century united state like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma and oxycontin but there be a significant element of various people point of view with regard to drug law and most but not all of that be not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slant in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drug other than marijuana the criminal justice system along with it often harsh liferuining penalty be obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptom be a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it come to certain drug a lack of compassion for fellow human a prejudice against people who use the drug that be not governmentallyapproved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity it morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for do so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily select group of drug be clearly not such a reason this be really the primary issue when it come to drug yet this program ignore it.so in sum the part of this program that neutrally present history without feed stereotype of drug user that be at the heart of the drug war mentality be pretty good and interesting and entertain but when it come to present a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and give the viewer examples not only of people with drug problem but also the many people who successfully incorporate drug into happy and successful live it pretty disappointing\n","neg: 0.165, neu: 0.688, pos: 0.147, compound: -0.9334, \n","consider this film be release year before i be bear i dont feel too bad for

borrowed story i guess he do a decent job of reinterpret it his punch seem to be lack at the begin while ralston try to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film director technique to attempt to find his own he open the film interestingly enough but fail to answer any direct answer sure the final day have arrive but could there be a concise answer a to how or good yet why these

fulcis gate to hell or even savinis crown achievement friday the th the final chapter you can appreciate all that go into make a terrifically gory film you cant tell the difference between reality and magic.i cant imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that be ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that be the reason you seek this film then you be waste your money a many other reviewer in here have note most of the gore be an aftermath you dont see the torture or the bloodshed a it happen you see whatever it look like afterwords.the gore well it here but not as much a one would hope or expect a man do get castrate and a woman do get hang by her east but other then those two scene and one involve a scalping there be nothing really much else to this film the scene of gore even in these three mentioned be still pretty tame in comparison to what you be hop for maybe it just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but i be expect a bit more call me sick or twisted but isnt that the only reason people be watch this film in the first place i honestly find myself bore in a lot of places.cannibal ferox be just another film that try to capitalize on a craze of a superior film while cannibal holocaust be not exactly a great film it be much good than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for you will feel cheated./\n","neg: 0.093, neu: 0.786, pos: 0.12, compound: 0.7964, \n","i always felt that ms. merkerson have never get a role fit her skill familiar to million a the lt. on law and order she have be

the film be over my head but even franco himself when quiz by critic who watch succubus admit that he didnt even understand the film and he direct it some might say that succubus be merely a precursor to his more admired work venus in fur consider his masterwork by francofaithful because it also adopt the surreal dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesnt truly know whether he/she be experience something real or imagine in a sense like the protagonist we be experience the same type of confusion .. certainly succubus be unconventional filmmaking where we arent give the key to what be exactly go on and a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesnt help matter succubus be also populate by beatnik type and poetspeak cormans film a bucket of blood poke fun at my personal favorite scene tease at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meet at a posh party .. quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequin be use rather unusually great location and jazz score

direct contrast to the first feature part two represent a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to cheâ—struggling liberator of a country to which he have no previous tie the change of set isnt just aesthetic from the autumn and spring grey of the woodland come a change of tone and heart to the feature replace the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and uised reality align to an all new struggle yet a che would go on to say himselfâ—such a struggle be best told exactly a thatâ—a struggle while part one certainly help document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquire through just that part two take a much more refined callous and bleak segment of ches life and ambition and give it an assertive portrayal that be both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner.while the movie tone in some regard do stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remain that same document approach take a month ago that avoids melodrama and faication as much a possible this somewhat distant cold approach to tell ches story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewer off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have be name after one manâ—if anything the entirety of che take a a whole delivers a tale that go beyond mere biography and instead document a man struggle alongside those who help carry him along the way by no mean do soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel do with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che be a slow moving reserve and meditative approach to tell a history lesson that just happen to be narrate by the one man who â–arguably conduct the whole thing.yet by move from the lush green landscape of cuba and retreat to the bleak decay backdrop of bolivia for part two the story do inevitably take on a distinctly contrast tone that doesnt feel too disjoint from it predecessor but do enough to give it it own reference point here the basic structure of part one be echo backâ—theres the initial struggle the battle the fall comrade and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpse of the man behind the movement yet a anyone with the vague idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two be destine to end on a much more underwhelming and disquiet note this difference in combination with the similarity to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all mean both could be digest one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieve a such and enjoy a they be but take a one statement che delivers exactly what it set out to achieve.indeed everything that make part one the treat that it be one month prior be still evident here from the subtle yet engross performance from the central cast to the slow building realistically structure combat scenesâ—the drama inherent to the character on screen be just a vague and indiscernible but with a feature such a this part two once again prove that avoid such element dont necessarily hurt a film when there be enough plot and reflection on other element to keep

adolescent try to understand woman behavior in a small city in brazil.this time however what catch my attention in the film be something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr. han suyin jennifer jones make clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition a an eurasian in fact she be constantly put emphasis on this point in their relationship repeat she be willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provide that by do so she be not betray her chinese side it seem to the spectator that suyin be eagerly make effort to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspect of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempt to control them.therefore suyins attitude always leave poor elliott â– a determine ave and extremely practical man â– anxious and perplexed without know how much importance to give to her word for him whose love for her be plain and simple the situation be totally clear if we love each other let u make a couple and begin immediately a life together not so fast be what she seem verbally and nonverbally to answer him all the time.in fact suyins chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism and a she go on and on reinforce this much aim equiliium between those two world inside herself she also frequently signal to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture be deeply root in her mind namely the constant raid on the real world by invisible being from an spiritual or nonphysical world for suyin be always alert elliott about how dangerous be life not because of any objective and concrete threat a would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion but due to the threat of plenty of cruel and harmful god and other mystical and mythical being over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings.in fact it look like a whole bunch of chinese deity be permanently on the watch to make people life totally miserable because of that mother must dress their precious male baby in girl clothes so that they be not take away by jealous god everyone should always be ready to make loud noise to send the cloud away in order to avoid their cover the sight of the moon peasant be advise that they should shout loudly the rice be bad the rice be bad to protect their crop from be steal by deity and in a funeral it be recommend that the dead family be isolate from the other people by curtain so that the god dont take advantage of their sorrow and fragility.in other word suyin introduces u to a culture in which the supernatural have a real existence a if a rather disturb pantheon of malign and sadistic god be always on the verge of negatively interfere with the most banal act in anyones daily life.as the story take place in hong kong in it should be clear that china really be at that time almost a semifeudal society while the country from which elliott have come from be not yet dominate by the fierce capitalism that launch by the usa after the first oil shock in take charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both side of suyins eurasian personality be still much more innocent than they would be today.a lot of history come into be since those old day a to china the main fact be that after several phase of a communist regime the country finally reach in the last two decade the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly describe a state capitalism and what happen to that old spirituality that so much enthral suyin in hong kong in and with which she use to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it be go completely go in ief if that story take place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in

the komodo bullet just wont go near it the best way to avoid be eat by a giant coa or a giant komodo dragon be just to stand there the exception to this rule be if youve be tell to stay very still in which case you should run off until the komodo be right next to you and then you should stand there expect defeat minute of choppy slow motion footage behind the credit really make for enjoyable watching be a memory enhancement tool and an ample substitute for lose your boat license/getting arrested member of elite army unit dont see giant komodo dragon come until they be within one metre of the oversized being maybe the computergenerated nature of these dragon have something to do with it when film a news story aim on expose illegal animal test a reporter and a cameraman with one camera be all the gear and personnel you will need sound gear a second camera microphone etc be all superfluous when you hear a loud animal scream and one person have a gun he should take it out and point it

expose something without have the faint idea what theyre expose background research and vague knowledge be out of fashion in modern journalism handgun hold at least bullet in one clip and then more
